 Program: Fusion Meeting Planner
 Data: March 20, 2017
 Description:  Plans faculty meetings for the teachers of each student, based on the following:
 - One meeting per student with all the teachers of that student.
 - 30 minute meeting timeslots, up to [4] meetings per timeslot, [14] timeslots per day.
 - Minimize conflicts (when a teacher has to attend more than one meeting in a given time slot).
 - Students are assigned to timeslots on a first come first serve basis based on their order in the Student List.
 - If student has conflict with next available timeslot, he is assigned to the next available timeslot.
 - If student has conflict with all available timeslots, he is assigned to first timeslot with least number of conflicts.
 - Student List may be sorted in: (i) original order, (ii) sorted by non ascending number of teachers of the student,
 -   (iii) sorted by total number of students of the teachers for the student, or (iv) any combination
 -   of (i), (ii) and (iii).
